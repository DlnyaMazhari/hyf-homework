Cottage cheese alfredo

Ingredients
Cottage cheese 100g
semi-skimmed milk 250ml
cornflour 1 tbsp
garlic granules 1 tsp
wholewheat spaghetti 150g
parmesan (or veggie alternative) 25g, finely grated
black peppercorns ground to make ½ tsp
flat-leaf parsley a small bunch, roughly chopped

Method
STEP 1

Tip the cottage cheese, milk, cornflour, garlic granules and a little seasoning into a high-powered blender or food processor, and whizz until completely smooth. Pour into a frying pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce until the consistency of pouring cream.

STEP 2

Cook the spaghetti in a large pan of lightly salted boiling water following pack instructions, drain well, reserving some of the cooking water, then tip into the sauce in the frying pan with the parmesan and black pepper. Toss well, adding some of the reserved pasta water if it’s a little claggy. Divide between two plates and finish with the parsley.
