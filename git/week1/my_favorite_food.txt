The Best Vegetable Soup
Not only is this soup delicious but and it’s so easy to make. It just takes some chopping and a bit of simmering until you’ve got a soup everyone will love!

This is a recipe you’ll definitely want to add to your dinner or lunch rotation. And it yields a pot full and makes great leftovers!

What Vegetables Should I Add to Vegetable Soup?
You can put whatever vegetables you like in this soup, from seasonal fresh veggies to frozen. Here’s a list of what I used;

carrots
celery
tomatoes
potatoes
green beans
corn
peas
yellow onion and garlic

This soup is jam packed with veggies and making it a healthy dinner choice.

I had two bowls then came back before bed for a third because I liked it so much. I love that it uses half fresh veggies and half frozen so you still get all that freshness but have the ease of pre-cut frozen veggies too.

During the summer when you have all the fresh veggies on hand definitely feel free to use all fresh instead.

Adding Extra Flavor – Herbs And Spices To Add
This soup has a mild seasoning blend to it which I prefer (because it lets the flavor of the vegetables shine) but you can definitely add more herb flavor or spices to taste. Here’s a few ideas of what you could add:

Fresh or dried herbs such as basil, thyme, oregano or marjoram.
Dried herb blends such as Italian seasoning or herbs de Provence.
Red pepper flakes will add a spicy kick.
Paprika or a curry powder.
Add a parmesan rind and simmer.
